    <h1>TalkUnlock Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <div class="effective-date">
        <strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 22, 2025<br>
        <strong>Last Updated:</strong> September 22, 2025
    </div>

    <p>TalkUnlock ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how our app ("the App") collects, uses, and safeguards your information when you use our services. By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to the practices described below.</p>

    <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
    <p>We design TalkUnlock to be privacy-first. We only collect the minimum data necessary to operate the app.</p>

    <h3>a. Information you provide directly</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account information (optional):</strong> If you sign up with email/password or other providers (e.g., Google, Apple), we collect your email address for authentication and account management.</li>
        <li><strong>Subscription and billing:</strong> If you purchase a subscription or one-time plan, Google Play or the App Store processes your payment. We do not see or store your credit card details. We only receive confirmation of your purchase and subscription status.</li>
        <li><strong>Custom phrases:</strong> If you create custom unlock phrases, they are stored locally on your device. They are not transmitted to us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>b. Information collected automatically</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>App usage data:</strong> We may collect limited, anonymized data such as app opens, feature usage (e.g., blocking sessions started), and error logs to improve stability and performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Device information:</strong> Basic details like device type, operating system version, and app version.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>c. Voice data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Voice input:</strong> The app uses your device's built-in speech recognition (Google Speech API on Android, Apple Speech framework on iOS). Voice input is processed locally by the operating system. We do not store, transmit, or have access to your raw voice recordings.</li>
        <li><strong>Recognition results:</strong> The recognized text is compared locally to your unlock phrase. It is not shared with us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How we use information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide and operate the App's core features (blocking apps/sites, voice unlock).</li>
        <li>Manage user accounts and subscriptions.</li>
        <li>Improve app performance, user experience, and stability.</li>
        <li>Communicate important service updates or support responses.</li>
        <li>Comply with legal obligations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How we do not use information</h2>
    <p>We do not:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sell your data to advertisers.</li>
        <li>Share your personal data with third parties for marketing.</li>
        <li>Record or store your voice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data storage and security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local storage:</strong> Unlock phrases and blocking preferences remain on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud storage (if account created):</strong> If you sign in, account and subscription info may be stored securely in Firebase Authentication and Firestore.</li>
        <li><strong>Security measures:</strong> We use encryption (HTTPS, TLS) and standard industry practices to protect data in transit and at rest.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data sharing</h2>
    <p>We may share limited data only in these cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> With trusted third-party services (e.g., Firebase, Google Play Billing) that help us run the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal requirements:</strong> If required by law, regulation, or valid legal request.</li>
        <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> In the unlikely event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Your rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access to the information we hold about you.</li>
        <li>Request correction or deletion of your data.</li>
        <li>Opt-out of analytics collection.</li>
        <li>Withdraw consent at any time (by deleting your account or uninstalling the app).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:talkunlock1@gmail.com">talkunlock1@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age in your region). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will delete it.</p>

    <h2>8. Third-party services</h2>
    <p>Our App relies on the following third-party providers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Play Billing / Apple App Store Billing</strong> – to process purchases.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase (Google LLC)</strong> – for optional authentication, crash reporting, and analytics.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each third-party has its own privacy policy, which we encourage you to review.</p>

    <h2>9. Data retention</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account information:</strong> kept until you delete your account or request erasure.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics and crash logs:</strong> retained for up to 12 months for troubleshooting and performance analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Local data (phrases, settings):</strong> deleted when you uninstall the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. If we make material changes, we will notify you via the App or by other means before the changes take effect.</p>
